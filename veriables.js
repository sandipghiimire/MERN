//veriables - They are veru important concep in every programming language that are used to hold (store) data and manipulate them.
//veriables can store valuas and expressions.
//Expressions are something that will evantually resolves to a value.

//Javascript is dynamically Typed programming language.

//Syntax:
//variable_type variable_name (identifier) = (assignment operator) value or expression.

//There are three ways to declare a variables in javascript. They are:-
//1. Var (Pre-ES6)
//2. let (ES6+)
//3. const (ES6+)

//Rules for Identifier:
//1. Identifier should always start with (a-z, A-Z, _, $)
//2. It shouldn't start with number or special characters except($,_).
//3. They are case sensative. It mean x and X are two different.
//4. There shouldn't be space between the identifier.

//Standard Conventions for Identifier in JS.
//1. Variables names should be in camelCase (eg, var myName;)
//2. Identifier must be descriptive and relevent to what kind of values it must hold(store).

//JavaScript is backward compatible pragramming language.

//var vs let vs const
//var - var is used to declare variable which value can or any change overtime in our program.
//2. Variable decaration only possible in var.(eg. var firstName;)
var firstName; // value Decelaration 
firstName="Sandip"; // value assign  
//3. Variable re-decleration is possible in var.

//let - let is used to declare variable which value can or any change overtime in our program.
//2. Variable decaration only possible in let. (eg. let lastName;)
let lastName; // value decelaration 
lastName="Ghimire"; //value assign
//3. Variable re-decleration is not possible in let.

//const - it is used to declare constant veriable.
//2. Variable decaration only is not possible in Constant.(eg. const address;x)
//3. Variable re-decleration is not possible in const.
